# MP Addons
I have decided to make this include public as my original intention was to release it with [MemoryPointer](https://github.com/alliedmodders/sourcemod/pull/2196), however it seems that it has now been scrapped in favour of a new enum struct type, which [Kenzzer](https://github.com/Kenzzer) has yet to announce. This is following new changes to the [SourcePawn](https://github.com/alliedmodders/sourcepawn) programming language, where [enum struct types may now be fed to and returned from natives](https://github.com/alliedmodders/sourcepawn/commit/6e00170bb00c06fcd14737ceabc9341d4a0410c7).

Have fun reading what I wrote, at least!
